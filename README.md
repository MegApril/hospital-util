# Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes by Intervention Type

## Project Overview
Riverside Regional Medical Center is a 350-bed, academic hospital in the Midwest specializing in advanced maternal and child healthcare for over 25 years. With over 5,000 annual deliveries, including a significant proportion of high-risk cases, Riverside faces rising costs and complex resource demands.

This analysis investigates associations between maternal interventions (like induced labor or cesarean delivery) and neonatal outcomes (such as NICU admission or APGAR score)

To complete this analysis, clinical data was used and can be found in the repository.
