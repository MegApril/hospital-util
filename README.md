# Hospital Utilization

## Project Background
Maternal and neonatal care comprise a significant area of healthcare, accounting for substantial hospital costs and resource use. High-cost conditions associated with pregnancy and childbirth present challenges not only in financial management but also in ensuring optimal clinical outcomes. Recognizing the need for actionable insights, The Hospital undertook a comprehensive analysis to identify key drivers of costs and utilization in maternal and neonatal services.

The goal of this initiative is to uncover conditions and care pathways that contribute most to hospital expenses, focusing on metrics such as total cost of care, cost per stay, length of stay (LOS), and readmission rates. Using clinical and billing data, we can optimize resource allocation, improve clinical outcomes and enhance the patient experience.

This will serve as a collaborative analysis to identify key drivers of costs and utilization in maternal and neonatal services. We will partner with Clinical Leadership from the Obstetrics and Neonatology departments to uncover insights and deliver recommendations to clinical leadership, financial teams, and hospital leadership. 

Insights will be provided in the following key areas:
**Clinical Teams**
- Focus on actionable changes to care pathways and patient outcomes
- Pinpointing opportunities for process improvements, such as care coordination or alternative care settings.
**Finance TEams**
- Identifying specific diagnoses or procedures responsible for high-cost, high-utilization patterns
- Highlighting avoidable costs linked to prolonged hospital stays, readmissions, or inefficiencies
**Hospital Leadership**
- Align findings with strategic goals and broader hospital priorities
  
## Data Structure and Initial Checks
## Executive Summary
## Reccomendations
- Cost-Saving Opportunities: Reducing unnecessary cesarean deliveries could save an average of $X per delivery.
- Quality Improvement Areas: Targeted prenatal programs for high-risk pregnancies could reduce NICU admissions by Y%
- Equity Interventions: Addressing racial disparities in preterm birth rates could reduce costs by Z% annually.

**Short Term Actions**
- pilot programs for specific conditions or populations
- enhanced care coordination for high cost diagnoses

**Long Term Goals**
- develop hospital wide protocols to address cost drivers
- Advocate for policy cghanges or funding to support maternal/fetal health
## Caveats and Assumptions


## Project Background
- [ ] 1-2 sentence summary of company the analysis is for.
- [ ] 1-2 sentences on how the company uses data, where the need for the analysis is and how the project fills that gap.
- [ ] Bulleted list of the areas the insights and recommendations are for
  - name of business area and definition of what that business area is
- [ ] Link out to the important (technical) stuff
  - Dashboard
  - Queries used to inspect and perform quality checks
  - Queries used to clean, organize, and prepare data for the dashboard
  - Targeted queries about various business questions
     
## Data Structure and Initial Checks
- [ ] ERD (entity relationship diagram)
  - Relationship of tables used so someone can get a sense of the domain of the data
  - Create on canvas (?)
## Executive Summary
- [ ] The most important information from the project.
- Keep it super simple
- [ ] 3-4 sentence summary of findings
- Link to technical stuff separately
- [ ] A few (3-4) bullets going one degree of detail deeper into each finding.
- include quantified value
- include business metric
- end with a simple story about a historical trend. Looking at what happened in the past and giving recommendations for the future.
- [ ] Visuals (if any)
- very simple and easy to read

## Recommendations 
"Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided."
- [ ] show a general understanding of how the recommendations could be useful for marketing, sales, etc.

## Bonus Section - caveats and assumptions
- A few bulletpoints about some of the roadblocks I ran into to show I understand the practical realities of working as a data analyst on the day to day job.


# README File Format
## Do's:
- Show insights and recommendations in the write-up for the project. How do we use these tools on the day-to-day job?
- Use GitHub to store projects to demonstrate that we know the data ecosystem.
- Have featured projects front and center and easy to find on the portfolio.
- Have company-specific metrics and the "so what" of what the analysis was.
- focus on key business metrics and slice the metrics by various segments

## Don't:
- Use generic names for projects on resumes or common datasets that everyone has already done.
- focus on what you did instead of what you found.
- include layers of links to get to the featured project.
- focus on personal or niche projects

## README General
Walks through these metrics and give context on what we are doing as if we are an actual data analyst at that company.
- Northstar metrics
  -(showing what the metric is and the definition of it),
- Summary of insights
   - (including plan type, plan period and plan region, and
- Recommendations & Next Steps.
   - form recommendations around guiding teams towards areas to investigate further
   - "Work with the product and sales team to understand why there's a dip in this specific plan type over the last three months."
